# Replication Files for Suk and Park (2026+)

This Github repository contains replication files for [Suk and Park (2026+)](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/xhwv4_v1 "FDA").


## Folders

Result_F folder contains CSV files with simulation results.

## Code

* Simulation_Functions.R includes functions used to implement the proposed mediation approach for functional outcomes.

* Simulation_Final.R contains the main script for replicating the simulation study. Parallel computing is recommended for efficient execution.

* Summary.R summarizes the simulation results in the Result_F folder and generates summary tables and a figure.
